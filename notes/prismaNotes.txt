1Q. How would something like archive employee work?
1A.  i To archive all users with the role of employee we would need their ids first.
    ii To get their ids we will look at the userRoleMapping table
          * The problem with that is there are multiple assignments for a single user in the table (because roles can change and every time a new entry is made)

    1. employeeRoleMappings = fetch entries from userRoleMapping where roleId is employee
    2. uniqueUserIds = extract unique userIds from employeeRoleMappings
    3. userIdsToArchive = []
    4. for each userId in uniqueUserIds:
        4.1 latestEntry = fetch the latest entry from userRoleMapping where userId is userId
        4.2 if latestEntry's roleId is employee:
            4.2.1 add userId to userIdsToArchive
    5. for each userId in userIdsToArchive:
        5.1 update user where id is userId to set archived to true
